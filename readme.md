# Google password revealer ?

This is a POF for revealing sensitive information by using the API chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest in a Chrome extension.
The password is displayed visually so DO NOT use your original password.

The point is "Please be aware of what you're installing and giving permissions to".

This extension is not intended to go on play store.

Finally do not be evil when you're using this. This is to increase awareness.

## Installing

Download the repo and [install it](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).


## Usage

Open gmail.com and enter your email but use a wrong password. 
Unless you want to display your password. In which case you should just [do this](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61177?hl=en)

## ToDo

Come up with a better name for this project.
